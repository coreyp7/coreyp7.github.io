      The Eiffel Tower at golden hour was everything I'd hoped for and more. We arrived about an hour before sunset and watched as the tower transformed from its daytime steel gray to this warm, glowing beacon. The crowds were manageable if you knew where to stand, and the street performers added such a lively atmosphere to the whole experience. I must have taken a hundred photos, but none quite captured the magic of being there in person.

      The Louvre's glass pyramid creates such interesting reflections throughout the day. We spent nearly six hours inside and barely scratched the surface. The Mona Lisa was smaller than expected, but the sheer scale of the building and the breadth of art was overwhelming in the best way. My favorite discovery was actually a small Egyptian sculpture gallery that was nearly empty but filled with incredible artifacts.

      Taking a evening cruise along the Seine was perhaps the most romantic part of the trip. The city lights reflected in the water, and you could see all the major landmarks from a completely different perspective. We brought a bottle of wine and some cheese from a local fromagerie, and just watched Paris drift by. The boat wasn't too crowded, and the commentary was actually quite interesting, sharing stories about the buildings and bridges we passed.

      Montmartre felt like stepping into a different era entirely. The cobblestone streets, the artists setting up their easels, the little cafés with their outdoor seating - it was exactly what I'd imagined Paris would be like. We climbed to Sacré-Cœur just as the sun was setting, and the view over the entire city was breathtaking. The neighborhood has such character, from the street art to the vintage shops tucked into narrow alleys.

      The local markets were where Paris really came alive for me. This particular market near our apartment was bustling with locals doing their daily shopping. The vendors were incredibly friendly, especially when they saw we were trying to practice our French. We bought fresh bread, local cheeses, and some of the best strawberries I've ever tasted. It felt like getting a glimpse into daily Parisian life, away from the tourist attractions.
