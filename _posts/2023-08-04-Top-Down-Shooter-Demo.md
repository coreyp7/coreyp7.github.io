A prototype of a overhead shooter game. I wanted to use my QuadTree implementation in a functional game instead of a
demo, and thought this would be a good genre to showcase that. 

You can move around and shoot projectiles (with cooldown) and defeat enemies. All enemies have a health bar showing
their HP (as well as the player).
