description: Open address hashtable in C (for my use in another project)
github-link: https://github.com/coreyp7/hashtable
---

An open address hashtable in C. Wrote it to use for a malloc / garbage collector I was making for a while.

May write an article / make an article on how hashtables are implemented and explaining it as simple as possible.
So, leaving here if I want to write a closed address impl and go further with it.
