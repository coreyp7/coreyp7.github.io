Had this idea for a while and spent a weekend or so making it. There were ideas I could've extrapolated on to make it more polished and fun (the hands don't even visually close when you close them lol), but had other things I wanted to work on so I moved on.

<p>
I thought it was a neat idea because you use the left/right control sticks to move your left/right hand, and use the left/right trigger to control opening and closing your left/right hand respectively. It proves oddly challenging being consistent with your throws (although this may mostly be due to the physics, which I struggled to have it nailed perfectly how I want it to feel).
