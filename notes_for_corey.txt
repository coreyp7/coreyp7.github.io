Hey,

This is a text file to give you a rundown on the shitty layout of this project so that you don't have to figure it out again when you wanna add stuff.

-- Jekyll commands --
bundle install (looks at gemfile and installs all dependencies into repository)
bundle exec jekyll serve (look at static pages, files, and combines into one website to run)


-- HTML Page Editing --
Home/Projects/Blog pages are in the root directory for some reason.

If you want to edit the page generally, you can start there.
From there, you can trace which layouts the page uses and figure out how shits being shown.

-- Blog Post / Projects listings --
Both projects and blog display using two separate files:
post_list.HTML
project_list.HTML

This is stupid because they're literally the same, but just search the header of
the markdown file for the 'category' field, which can be one of two fields rn:
project
blog

So if you wanna change the way its listed, you gotta do it to both files.

-- Styling --
assets/styles.css

I ignore the scss stuff. Idk how all that works anymore, look into it if you have to.
