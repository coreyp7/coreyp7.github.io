Hey, I know you'll forget this stuff (even though its way simpler now). 
So some quick notes.

for testing:
    bundle exec jekyll serve

Add new posts in _posts dir, make sure the date formatting matches.
Additionally, mark 'category' in the file depending on type of thing it is:
- 'project'
- 'blog' for normal posts

The navbar is at the top of '_layouts/default.html'.

The 'post.html' layout actually inherits from 'default.html' to get the navbar.

If you want to update the resume link, its in the '_config.yml'.
