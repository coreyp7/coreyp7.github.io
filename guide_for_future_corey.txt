Hey, I know you'll forget this stuff (even though its way simpler now). 
So some quick notes.

for testing:
    bundle exec jekyll serve

Add new posts in _posts dir, make sure the date formatting matches.
Additionally, mark 'category' in the file depending on type of thing it is:
- 'project'
- 'blog' for normal posts

The navbar is at the top of '_layouts/default.html'.

The 'post.html' layout actually inherits from 'default.html' to get the navbar.

If you want to update the resume link, its in the '_config.yml'.

Right now there's just css in html files. There's very little so its fine.
If you want to be a good samaritan then move it out to its own file.

Travel pages:
- Main travel page: /travel.html (shows list of destinations)
- Individual destination pages: use layout 'destination' in front matter
- Destination layout: creates photo sections with alternating image/text layout
- Photos are 50% width, text is 50% width, alternating left/right
- Add new destinations by creating new .html files with 'destination' layout
